#Basic operators

number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
print(number)

# And then using the modulo operator rip
remainder = 11 % 3
print(remainder)

# Power relationship
squared = 7 ** 2 # Erm, what's 7x7
cubed = 2 ** 3

# Operators with strings

helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"
print(helloworld)

lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10 # Basically repeats it
print(lotsofhellos)

# Operators with lists

even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
odd_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers

print([1, 2, 3] * 3) #Result = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
